Bloxstrap but... with EXTRA presets :tongue: 

some stuff might save incorrectly so please check and re-enable if they dont work

Step 1: Open bloxstrap, go to the behavior tab, turn off automatic updates

Step 2: Download the exe


Step 3: go to %localappdata%/Bloxstrap


Step 4: paste the exe you downloaded into that folder where your current bloxstrap is


step 5: PROFIT (and do NOT use the language option)
